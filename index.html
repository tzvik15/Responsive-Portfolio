                <p class="break" id="pOne">Hello everyone, and thank you for visiting my developer site! In this section I will tell you a little about myself, my history, and the work I've done and hoping to do.</p>
                <p class="break" id="pTwo">Let's start with the basics of my background. My formal studies were in the fields of music and education (I have a doctorate in performance and pedagogy!) I grew up in Israel, where I did my undergrad, and later moved to Los Angeles and finally to Colorado for my graduate work.</p>
                <p class="break" id="pThree">It was here in Colorado that I learned how important collaboration is to me. In fact, the concept is so meaningful for me that I wrote my doctoral thesis on the subject!</p>
                <br>
                <p class="break" id="pFour">I took my first steps as a developer at the University of Denver, where I immedietly began encorporating my thoughts and ideas on collaborative work into my studies, collaborating on projects, and working with my cohort members to help and support each other in our journey as developers.</p>
                <p class="break" id="pFive">As a developer, I am passionate about using JavaScript to find creative solutions to coding challenges. An example of my JS can be seen in my "Bone'z Beatz" project, where I used JS to connect dynamically between sound files and key strokes, creating a fully custumizable soundboard application. (more about this project <a href="projects/bonez.html">HERE</a>)</p>
                <p class="break" id="pSix">As my client, I will work together with you, collaborating to realize the projects you envision, providing you with the best quality and support, and the knowledge that the final product will truely be a part and representation of YOU and YOUR needs.</p>
                <p class="break" id="pSeven">You can see examples of my projects in the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section. <a href="https://github.com/tzvik15" target="_blank">THIS</a> is a link to my GitHub page, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nester-aa074a189/" target="_blank">THIS</a> is a link to my LinkedIn page, and <a href="./assets/documents/Coding Resume.pdf" download target="_blank">HERE</a> you can download my resume.
