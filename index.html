                <p id="pOne">Hello everyone, and thank you for visiting my developer portfolio! In this section I will tell you a little about myself, my hitory, and the importance of <strong>Harmony</strong> to my work!</p>
                <p id="pTwo">Let's start with the basics of my background. My original training is in the fields of music and education (I have a doctorate in performance and pedagogy!) I grew up in Israel, where I did my undergrad, and later moved to Los Angeles and finally to Colorado for my graduate work.</p>
                <p id="pThree">It was here in Colorado that I learned how important collaboration is to me. In fact, the concept is so meaningful for me that I wrote my doctoral thesis on the subject!</p>
                <br>
                <p class="break" id="pFour">I took my first steps as a developer at the University of Denver, where I immedietly began encorporating my thoughts and ideas on collaborative work into my studies, working with my cohort members to help and support each other in our journies as developers.</p>
                <p class="break" id="pFive">As my client, I will work together with you, collaborating to realize the projects you envision, providing you with the best quality and support, and the knowledge that the final product will truely be a part and representation of YOU and YOUR needs.</p>
